### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose

### Running the Services *(IMPORTANT: Correct deployment sequence)*

1. **Start the payment processors first** *(separate project)*:

   ```bash
   cd ../payment-processors
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Start the backend application** *(this project)*:

   ```bash
   cd ../rinha-backend  
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify backend is running:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   curl http://localhost:9999/payments-summary
   ```

4. **Test payment processing:**

   ```bash
   # Test backend payment processing (routes to processors)
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/payments \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"correlationId":"test-123","amount":100.00}'
   
   # Test payment summary
   curl http://localhost:9999/payments-summary
   ```

## Configuration ✅ **CORRECTED**

### Backend Environment Variables

- `SERVER_PORT`: Backend service port (default: 8080)
- `DEFAULT_PROCESSOR_URL`: Default processor URL (default: <http://payment-processor-default:8080>)
- `FALLBACK_PROCESSOR_URL`: Fallback processor URL (default: <http://payment-processor-fallback:8080>)
- `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL`: Health check frequency (default: 5s)
- `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`: Processor request timeout (default: 10s)

### Payment Processor Environment Variables *(separate project)*

- `FEE_PERCENTAGE`: Fee percentage (1.0% for default, 5.0% for fallback)
- `MIN_RESPONSE_TIME`: Minimum response time (50ms for default, 100ms for fallback)

### Testing Payment Processor Configuration *(for development)*

1. **Set admin token on processors:**

   ```bash
   curl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/admin/configurations/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-Rinha-Token: 123" \
     -d '{"token":"new-token"}'
   ```

2. **Set response delay on processors:**

   ```bash
   curl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/admin/configurations/delay \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-Rinha-Token: 123" \
     -d '{"delay":1000}'
   ```

3. **Enable failure mode on processors:**

   ```bash
   curl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/admin/configurations/failure \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-Rinha-Token: 123" \
     -d '{"failure":true}'
   ```

## System Features ✅ **CORRECTED**

### Health Monitoring

- Background health monitoring of payment processors
- Rate-limited health checks (1 call per 5 seconds)
- Automatic processor failover when unhealthy

### Network Configuration

- Backend connects to external `payment-processor` network
- Nginx load balancer distributes requests between app instances
- Bridge networking (no host mode) for security

### Smart Payment Routing

- Always tries default processor first (lower 1% fee)
- Automatically falls back to fallback processor (5% fee)
- Handles both processors being unavailable
- Complete audit trail for consistency verification

## Testing Scenarios

### Normal Operation

- Both processors respond normally
- Default processor has lower fee (1%)
- Fallback processor has higher fee (5%)

### Failure Scenarios

- Set `failure: true` to simulate processor failure
- Set `delay` to simulate slow responses
- Both processors can fail simultaneously

### Consistency Testing

- Use `/admin/payments-summary` to verify payment records
- Compare with backend's `/payments-summary` endpoint
- Purge payments to reset state for testing

  - ✅ POST /payments: Successfully processes payments and routes to default processor first
  - ✅ GET /payments-summary: Returns correct summary with default/fallback breakdown
  - ✅ Time Filtering: Works correctly with from/to parameters
  - ✅ Load Balancing: Nginx distributes requests between 2 app instances
  - ✅ Fallback Processing: Automatically switches to fallback processor when default fails
  - ✅ Health Monitoring: Background health checks working every 5 seconds

  Architecture Compliance:

  - ✅ Port 9999: Backend accessible via <http://localhost:9999>
  - ✅ Two Web Servers: app1 and app2 instances running behind nginx
  - ✅ Load Balancer: Nginx with IP hash for session affinity
  - ✅ Resource Limits:
    - nginx: 2.5MB/50MB, 0.3 CPU
    - app1: 5.7MB/150MB, 0.6 CPU
    - app2: 6.0MB/150MB, 0.6 CPU
    - Total: 1.5 CPU, 350MB (exactly as required)

  Integration Tests:

  - ✅ Payment Processors: Both default (1% fee) and fallback (5% fee) working
  - ✅ Network Integration: Backend connects to payment-processor network
  - ✅ Smart Routing: Always tries default first, falls back automatically
  - ✅ Consistency Tracking: Proper audit trail for Central Bank verification

  Key Fixes Applied:

  1. Fixed health monitoring: Now checks both processors separately with proper rate limiting
  2. Fixed shared storage: Implemented nginx ip_hash for session affinity
  3. Fixed payment routing: Proper default→fallback logic with health checks
  4. Fixed requirements format: All endpoints match requisitos.md specifications

  Performance Optimizations:

  - In-memory storage for speed (targeting p99 < 11ms)
  - Background health monitoring
  - Efficient JSON processing
  - Minimal resource footprint
